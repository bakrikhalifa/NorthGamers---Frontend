## About the project

This project was built as part of the Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp at Northcoders. The goal was to create a backend API that would provide the necessary tools for a front-end architecture to be built. The API was built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, and the front-end was built using React, HTML5, CSS3.
